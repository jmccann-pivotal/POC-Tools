SAS Training - June 8, 2012

SAS Bulk Loading with gpfdist

Install/Configure/Test

Must use gpfdist, not gpload.

gpfdist runs on window server talking to GPDB

Must have connectivity set on SAS side set with "libname" command.

create table with 
BULKLOAD
BL_HOST (host running gpfdist)
BL_PORT (gpfdist port)

environment variable BL_USE_PIPE needs to be set on Unix environment to stream data with gpfdist.

multi-tier architecture is 4 levels max

Client:  

SAS Data Integration Studio
Enterprise Guide
Enterprise Miner Client
Mgmt Console

Server:

Various SAS servers - BI, EDI, Metadata, EM

Low Level:   computer servers (gpdb)

Most SAS users use procs and datastep (macros) for loading data, not SQL.

load occurs during "data" step

Make sure you include "DISTRIBUTED_BY" clause in data step.  DISTRIBUTED_BY='distributed by(id)'

SAMPLE FROM COVENTRY HEALTH:

libname sastbls 'SAS-data-library';
libname gptabls greenplm host="pacr-srv-dwa202" db=cdwpoc user=gp_sas password=password schema=sas_sandbox;
 
proc sql;
create table gptabls.mynewtbl
    (bulkload=YES
     BL_HOST="pacr-srv-chc044.cvty.com"
     bl_port='8082'
     bl_protocol='gpfdist')
        as select * from sastbls.mysastbl;
Quit;

BL_ENCODING='LATIN1' - seems to work best for SAS

Table is created based on what the data looks like.   Cannot do columnar table creation.
You could create a table up front with the columnar append and just use the "append" proc to load it.

Adding data to a table is done with an "append" proc.   It skips the create table step but creates
an external table.   Have to be sure data sets are the same.

Data Integration Studio is the tool used to load data into GreenPlum.

If multi-tier architecture, you have to go into management console and set up GreenPlum connectivity 
there so all other tools can see it.

SAS Management console manages all SAS tools.  Metadata Server must be running for SAS Management
Console can see everything.

JBoss needs to be running for Java.

Object Spawner and Remote Managment services need to be running as well.

Server Manager is where you add the GreenPlum server.   Wizard walks you through this.  Sets up all the
information.

After server is set up, then you need to set up the connection library.
Then register tables in the database.

When you do a join, it will say it is creating a table but that is in SAS, not GP.

SAS Enterprise Guide is GUI way to create SAS programs.

In Data Loader, specifiy options in Options tab to utilize GreenPlum features.

This will generate the same code we were shown earlier for complex load jobs.
