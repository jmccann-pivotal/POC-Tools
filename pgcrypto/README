To build the public.key and secret.key files:

gpg --gen-key   - follow instructions.  Did not use passphrase.

gpg --list-secret-keys   - find the keys you generated

gpg -a --export XXXXXXX > public.key   From list-secret-keys, this is the entry
next to "ssb"    In my case, it was 732D5C15.

gpg -a --export-secret-keys XXXXXX > secret.key     From list-secret-keys,
this is the entry next to "sec".  In my case, it was 8AF2B704.

Files using the PGP encryption functions and public/private keys:

pgptable.sql - creates the table used - username and a social security number
validate_myusers.sh - checks the key used to encrypt data
load_a_user.sh - given a user and an SS number, loads a row
decrypt_myusers.sh - decrypts all rows in the table

load_myuser.sh and load_myuser2.sh were first cuts at adding users.
